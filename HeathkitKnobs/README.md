These are 3D models for some knobs for Heathkit equipment.

knob-medium: Medium sized knob used on test equipment and radios like
the Heathkit HR-10B.

knob-large: Large sized knob used on test equipment and radios like
the Heathkit HR-10B.

knob-small: Small sized knob used on test equipment and radios like
the Heathkit HR-10B.

The .scad files are the original OpenSCAD files that were created by
hand. The .stl files were generated from OpenSCAD and are suitable for
loading into your 3D printer/slicer software, such as Cura.

They are intended to be printed using a 3D printer. I have had good
results with these using LulzBot Mini and Prusa i3 printers. Use the
highest quality, but don't expect the quality to be the same as the
original knobs.

You should print these using support material. After printing, remove
the support material. You may need to file the hole for the shaft
slightly to get it to fit. An 8-32 set screw of suitable length is
needed to tighten the knob on the shaft. For the knobs that have
pointers, you can apply some white paint on the pointer.

I used PLA material. You can experiment with other materials. ABS, for
example, could potentially be treated with acetone to make the knobs
smoother.
